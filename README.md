# Overview

This program is a application of my knowledge of the the C++ language. I am furthering my experience in this language by creating a playlist maker.

This software allows users to create playlists and add songs to individual playlists. A user can also remove playlists, remove individual songs, and display the entire music library or all playlists.


I wrote this software to explore an idea that I had and expose myself to new programming languages.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
